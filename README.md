# A review of data preprocessing methods #
This code is a part of my bachelor thesis on data preprocessing. Significant part of the code
is for analysing the used datasets and performing grid searches and evaluations, so some of it
might make little sense outside of the experimental environment. This project is heavily based
on scikit-learn's *Pipelines* and *Transformers* (see *transformers* and *imputers* directories).
This code was never meant for a production environment and contains many experimental scripts and
Jupiter notebooks used during development.
